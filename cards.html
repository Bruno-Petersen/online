<h2 id="Properties of prompts">Properties of prompts</h2>
<p>Retrieval practice prompts should be <b><mark>focused</mark>.</b> A question or answer involving too much detail will dull your concentration and stimulate incomplete retrievals, leaving some bulbs unlit. Unfocused questions also make it harder to check whether you remembered all parts of the answer and to note places where you differed. It’s usually best to focus on one detail at a time.</p>
<br>
<p>Retrieval practice prompts should be <b><mark>precise</mark></b> about what they’re asking for. Vague questions will elicit vague answers, which won’t reliably light the bulbs you’re targeting.</p>
<br>
<p>Retrieval practice prompts should produce <b><mark>consistent</mark></b> answers, lighting the same bulbs each time you perform the task. Otherwise, you may run afoul of an interference phenomenon called “retrieval-induced forgetting”</p>
<p>This effect has been produced in many experiments but is not yet well understood.</p>
<p>: what you remember during practice is reinforced, but other related knowledge which you <i>didn’t</i> recall is actually inhibited. Now, there is a useful type of prompt which involves generating new answers with each repetition, but such prompts leverage a different theory of change. We’ll discuss them briefly later in this guide.</p>
<br>
<p>Retrieval practice prompts should be <b><mark>tractable</mark></b>. To avoid interference-driven churn and recurring annoyance in your review sessions, you should strive to write prompts which you can almost always answer correctly. This often means breaking the task down, or adding cues.</p>
<br>
<p>Retrieval practice prompts should be <b><mark>effortful</mark></b>. It’s important that the prompt actually involves retrieving the answer from memory. You shouldn’t be able to trivially infer the answer. Cues are helpful, as we’ll discuss later—just don’t “give the answer away.” In fact, effort appears to be an important factor in the effects of retrieval practice.</p>
<p>That’s one motivation for spacing reviews out over time: if it’s too easy to recall the answer, retrieval practice has little effect.</p>

<p><b><mark>Attributes and tendencies</mark></b>: What makes x, x? What’s always, sometimes, and never true of x?</p>

<p><b><mark>Similarities and differences</mark></b>: Knowing what x is requires knowing what relates and distinguishes it from other adjacent concepts.</p>
<br>
<p><b><mark>Parts and wholes</mark></b>: What are some examples of x? Are there important “sub-concepts” of x? Is “x” a part of some broader category? Visualize a Venn diagram, even if the edges are fuzzy.</p>
<br>
<p><b><mark>Causes and effects</mark></b>: What does x do? What causes it to do that? What doesn’t it do? When is it used?</p>
<br>
<p><b><mark>Significance and implications</mark></b>: Why does x matter? What does it suggest? Make the concept personally meaningful.</p>

</li></ul>
<br>
<p><b><mark>False negatives:</mark></b> How might you know the information the prompt intends to capture but <i>fail</i> to produce the correct answer? Such failures are often caused by not including enough context.</p>

<h3 id="Most questions and answers should be atomic:">Most questions and answers should be atomic:</h3>
<p>Early in his own personal memory practice, one of us was learning the Unix command to create links in the filesystem. He entered the following question into his memory system: “How to create a soft link from linkname to filename”. Together with the corresponding answer “ln -s filename linkname”. This looks like a good question, but he routinely forgot the answer. To address this, he refactored the card into two more atomic cards. One card: “What’s the basic command and option to create a soft link?” (A: “ln -s”). Second card: “When creating a soft link, in what order do linkname and filename go?” (A: “filename linkname”). Breaking the card into more atomic pieces turned a question he routinely got wrong into two questions he routinely got right. It seemed that the more atomic questions brought more sharply into focus what he was forgetting, and so provided a better tool for improving memory. And what of the original card? Initially, he deleted it. But he eventually added the card back, with the same question and answer, since it served to integrate the understanding in the more atomic cards. </p>

<p>These are cards which don’t connect closely to anything else. Suppose, for the sake of illustration, that you’re trying to learn about African geography, and have a question: “What’s the territory in Africa that Morocco disputes?” (A: “The Western Sahara”) If you don’t know anything about the Western Sahara or Morocco or why there’s a dispute, that question will be an orphan, disconnected from everything else. Ideally, you’ll have a densely interconnected web of questions and answers, everything interwoven in striking ways. </p>

<h3 id="Provide questions and answers in multiple forms:">Provide questions and answers in multiple forms: </h3>
<p>In 1971, the psychologist Allan Paivio proposed the dual-coding theory, namely, the assertion that verbal and non-verbal information are stored separately in long-term memory. Paivio and others investigated the <i>picture superiority effect</i>, demonstrating that pictures and words together are often recalled substantially better than words alone. This suggests, for instance, that the question “Who was George Washington’s Vice President?” may have a higher recall rate if accompanied by a picture of Washington, or if the answer (John Adams) is accompanied by a picture of Adams. For memory systems the dual-coding theory and picture superiority effect suggest many questions and ideas. How much benefit is there in presenting questions and answer in multiple forms? Perhaps even with multiple pictures, or in audio or video (perhaps with multiple speakers of different genders, different accents, <i>etc</i>), or in computer code? Perhaps in a form that demands some form of interaction? And in each case: what works best? </p>
<br>
<h3 id="Vary the context:">Vary the context: </h3>
<p>In 1978, the psychologists Steven Smith, Arthur Glenberg, and Robert Bjork reported several experiments studying the effect of place on human memory. In one of their experiments, they found that studying material in two different places, instead of twice in the same place, provided a 40% improvement in later recall. This is part of a broader pattern of experiments showing that varying the context of review promotes memory. We can use memory systems to support things like: changing the location of review; changing the time of day of review; changing the background sound, or lack thereof, while reviewing. In each case, experiments have been done suggesting an impact on recall. It’s not necessarily clear how robust the results are, or how reproducible – it’s possible some (or all) are the results of other effects, uncontrolled in the original experiment. Still, it seems worth building systems to test and (if possible) improve on these results.</p>

<h3 id="How do the cards interact with one another? What is the ideal network structure of knowledge?">How do the cards interact with one another? What is the ideal network structure of knowledge? </h3>
<p>This is a very complicated and somewhat subtle set of questions. Let’s give a simple example to illustrate the idea. We’ve presented the cards in the mnemonic medium as though they are standalone entities. But there are connections between the cards. Suppose you have cards: “Who was George Washington’s Vice President?” (Answer: “John Adams”, with a picture of Adams); “What did John Adams look like?” (Answer: a picture of Adams); perhaps a question involving a sketch of Adams and Washington together at some key moment; and so on. Now, this set of cards forms a network of interrelated cards. And you can use a memory system like <i>Quantum Country</i> to study that network. What happens to people’s observed recall if you remove a card? Are there crucial lynchpin cards? Are there particularly effective network structures? Particularly effective types of relationship between cards? Crucially: are there general principles we can identify about finding the deepest, most powerful ways of representing knowledge in this system?  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Memory is not an end-goal in itself. It’s embedded in a larger context: things like creative problem-solving, problem-finding, and all the many ways there are of taking action in the world. We suspect the impact of memory systems will vary a lot, depending on their design. They may be used as crutches for people to lean on. Or they may be used to greatly enable people to develop other parts of their cognition. We don’t yet understand very well how to ensure they’re enablers, rather than crutches. But later in the essay we’ll describe some other tools for thought that, when integrated with memory systems, may better enable this transition to more effective action. </p>
